            The paths along the trail routes of this mountain were laid in as early as 1825 and this is proof enough to show that Penang Hill is one of the sturdiest trekking routes in Malaysia in the recent times. Apart from sinking in the natural beauty of these trails, you can find a temple, mosque, bird park, food stalls selling local delicacies and many more sights as you go up the hill.

            This is one of the lesser-explored destinations in Malaysia and its main attraction is its unspoilt beauty. Located at Taman Melawati, near the famous National Zoo, Bukit Tabur is less than 500m tall.
            One can get proficient in rock climbing skills as well at this peak, as all the way to the peak, one will find many sizes of rocks. Not recommended for people who are new to the area and who are new to trekking.
            Though it takes just about 3 hours to finish the entire trekking trip, hiking at Bukit Tabur is not a walk in the park. The trails are tricky and confusing at most of the places. West, East & Far East are the 3 primary trails in this mountain. Use of professional guide is mandatory if one is new to the area.
            The best timing would be in September to February. Hike permit charges come up to RM5 per person.
