            Sipadan Island is the only island built on a volcanic seamount from the surrounding seabed. Its blue water is 500 meters deep. It has become a hanging garden filled with radiant corals. It is ideal for Wall Diving. For starters, we suggest diving within the 3-6-meter area. Swim with the turtle friends and bumphead parrot fishes at the Turtle Tomb. Be amazed with a school fishes at the Barracuda Point; visit the Mid-Reef, home to hard corals and reef fishes.

          Snorkelling is a ‘must-do’ recreation activity when holidaying at Langkawi Island to explore marine life. The best places to snorkel around the island are at Datai Bay Beach and Chabang Island (a near 10-minute walk from Tanjung Rhu Beach). Since Datai Bay Beach is a private beach, we recommend staying at the Andaman Resort and the Datai Resort. We also recommend taking boat rides to Pulau Payer Marine Park and Pulau Dangli Beach. Ask the boat operators when the best time is to dive and explore the reefs.

            Redang is the first island in our list that is not located in Borneo. Redang Island lies within the Terengganu Marine Park, nearby the city of Kuala Terengganu at the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia. Redang offers great dive sites and perfect dive conditions. It is a great place to start with your diving adventure, as prices of a 4 day PADI course are very affordable. Redang cannot be visited between October and March because of the monsoon season

            Snorkelling in Tioman Island is popular among tourists. There are plenty of snorkelling sites, including holiday resorts for you to rent the gear (less than RM$100 (USD$25) per person). Coral Island and Malang Rocks has plenty of marine life to explore. Renggis Island is one of the best spot to snorkel in this tropical island. Its shallow waters provide a magnificent view of corals in the vast reefs. Have fun with the turtles, puffer fishes and clown fishes at the Salang Beach.

            Perhentian is the best island in Malaysia to do a diving course. The diving conditions are splendid for beginners, and there are many dive spots available to enjoy immediately after finishing the PADI course. Perhentian has calm waters and an abundance of marine life. Besides diving it is probably one of the best islands for snorkeling, with shallow reefs with pretty nice corals and great marine life (also big fish and many turtles). At Perhentian prices for fun dives and for the diving course are probably the lowest in Malaysia. If you are a beginner, Perhentian Island is definitely the place to be!

            Layang-Layang is not a tropical island per se. It is a concrete landing strip with one resort and a marine base, located on a big sand bank located just below sea level. Layang-Layang is located in a remote area, where the underwater world has not been affected by human beings. Corals are in pristine conditions. Layang-Layang is a place to see big species and big schools of fish (not so much smaller stuff).
            Layang Layang Island is coined as ‘The Jewel of Borneo Banks’ near Kota Kinabalu, Sabah. It has breathtaking underwater scenery of 13 linked coral walls and large sea animals in crystal-clear waters. Check out their mesmerising diving sites, including Crack Reef, Dogtooth Lair, D’Wall, Gorgonian Forest, Navigator’s Lane and Shark’s Cave. You will see the hammerhead sharks, pygmy seahorses, barracudas and manta rays among the island’s marine life. We recommend visiting between March and October to avoid heavy monsoon season

            You can also indulge in various water sports like snorkeling, scuba diving, and witness the beautiful coral and marine life of the island. The island tours can be booked on the spot from where you will take your ferries.
            The Tunku Abdul Rahman Park is just 20 minutes boat ride from the Kota Kinabalu.
            The Jesselton Jetty ferry terminal consistently operates the boats to the Island, which takes around 20 minutes to reach there.
            The approximate cost for the complete tour starts from 53 MYR per adult.
            Opens at 8.30 AM till 5 PM
